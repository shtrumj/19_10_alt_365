# üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT - Synckey Format Mystery

## The Problem

iPhone **STILL rejects** our UUID-based synckeys `{1fddbfd9-f320-4b2f-b68c-bd757523bce5}1`

## ü§î Key Realizations

### 1. Grommunio UUID Format May Be INTERNAL ONLY!

Looking at Grommunio source code more carefully:

**What Grommunio Does:**
- Parses incoming synckeys with `ParseStateKey()` to extract UUID+counter  
- Uses UUID+counter for **internal state management**
- But what does it **send back to clients**?

### 2. Microsoft Spec Says: "Opaque String"

MS-ASCMD says synckey is an "opaque string" chosen by server.
- Could be: "1", "2", "3"...
- Could be: "abc123", "def456"...
- Could be: "{uuid}1", "{uuid}2"...

### 3. FolderSync Works with Simple Integers!

**Our FolderSync response:**
```
SyncKey: "1"
Result: ‚úÖ iPhone accepts!
```

**Our Sync response:**
```
SyncKey: "{1fddbfd9-f320-4b2f-b68c-bd757523bce5}1"
Result: ‚ùå iPhone rejects!
```

## üí° Hypothesis: iPhone Doesn't Support UUID Format

**Maybe:**
1. Grommunio's UUID format is for Z-Push compatibility
2. Real Exchange uses simple integers or base64 strings
3. iPhone expects Exchange-style synckeys, not Grommunio-style

## üîç What We Need To Test

### Test 1: Revert to Simple Integer Synckeys
```python
# BEFORE (UUID):
response_sync_key = "{1fddbfd9-f320-4b2f-b68c-bd757523bce5}1"

# AFTER (Simple):
response_sync_key = "1"  # Just like FolderSync!
```

### Test 2: Check Real Exchange Synckeys

Need to capture what REAL Microsoft Exchange sends:
- Packet capture from iPhone ‚Üí Exchange
- Look at synckey format in response
- Compare with our implementation

## üìä Evidence Supporting Simple Integer Theory

1. ‚úÖ **FolderSync works** with synckey="1"
2. ‚úÖ **All documentation** shows synckey as simple integers in examples
3. ‚úÖ **iPhone accepts** simple "1" for FolderSync
4. ‚ùå **iPhone rejects** UUID format for Sync

## üéØ Next Action

**REVERT UUID IMPLEMENTATION** and try with simple integers like FolderSync!

The UUID format may have been a **misinterpretation** of Grommunio's internal state management.
