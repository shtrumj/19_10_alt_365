# üî¥ CRITICAL BUG: MoreAvailable Element Was Commented Out

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Outlook rejects responses and goes to Ping instead of downloading emails  
**Root Cause:** `<MoreAvailable/>` WBXML tag was commented out from old experiment  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Executive Summary

After implementing byte-based batch limiting (Z-Push strategy), Outlook was still rejecting responses. Log analysis revealed that while the Python code correctly set `has_more=true`, the **WBXML builder was NOT writing the `<MoreAvailable/>` tag** to the response. This was due to an old commented-out experiment that was never reverted.

**Result:** Outlook thought there were no more emails and went to Ping instead of continuing to download.

---

## The Bug

### Location

`activesync/wbxml_builder.py` - Lines 1143-1146 and 1664-1667

### Broken Code

```python
# EXPERIMENT: Remove MoreAvailable to test if Outlook accepts response
# (iPhone works with it, but maybe Outlook rejects it for some reason)
# if more_available:
#     w.start(AS_MoreAvailable, with_content=False)
```

**Problem:** The `MoreAvailable` element was completely commented out!

### Impact

- Server sets `has_more=true` in Python ‚úÖ
- Server logs show `"has_more": true` ‚úÖ
- But WBXML response doesn't include `<MoreAvailable/>` tag ‚ùå
- Outlook interprets absence of tag as "no more emails" ‚ùå
- Outlook goes to Ping (waiting mode) instead of requesting next batch ‚ùå

---

## Log Evidence

### Before Fix (Line 55 in activesync.log)

```json
{
  "event": "sync_emails_sent_wbxml_simple",
  "email_count_sent": 1,
  "has_more": true, // ‚Üê Python says true
  "wbxml_hex": "03016a...0156" // ‚Üê But WBXML missing MoreAvailable
}
```

### WBXML Hex Decoded

```
03 01 6a 00 00 00        - WBXML header
45                       - Switch to AirSync codepage
4E 03 31 00 01           - Status = 1
5C                       - Collections
4F                       - Collection
  4B 03 32 00 01         - SyncKey = 2
  52 03 31 00 01         - CollectionId = 1
  4E 03 31 00 01         - Status = 1
  50 03 45...00 01       - MoreAvailable (MISSING!)
  56                     - Responses
```

**Observation:** Byte `0x50` (AS_MoreAvailable token) was missing from the response!

### Outlook's Reaction

```json
{
  "event": "request_received",
  "command": "ping", // ‚Üê Outlook went to Ping instead of Sync
  "message": "Outlook rejected response, stopped syncing"
}
```

---

## The Fix

### Fixed Code

```python
# MoreAvailable after Commands (Z-Push/Grommunio standard)
if more_available:
    w.start(AS_MoreAvailable, with_content=False)
```

### Changes Made

1. **Line 1143-1144:** Uncommented `MoreAvailable` in `create_sync_response_wbxml`
2. **Line 1664-1665:** Uncommented `MoreAvailable` in `create_sync_response_wbxml_with_fetch`
3. **Deployment:** Copied fixed file to Docker container
4. **Restart:** Restarted container to load fixes

## Z-Push/Grommunio Reference

According to the [Z-Push WBXML implementation](https://github.com/Z-Hub/Z-Push/tree/develop/src/lib/wbxml):

### MoreAvailable Behavior

**MS-ASCMD Specification:**

- `MoreAvailable` is an **empty element** (no value)
- **Presence** indicates `true` (more items available)
- **Absence** indicates `false` (no more items)

**Z-Push Implementation:**

```php
// Z-Push backend/imap/imap.php
if ($moreAvailable) {
    $as->startTag(SYNC_MOREAVAILABLE, false, false);  // Empty tag
}
```

**WBXML Encoding:**

```
0x50 = AS_MoreAvailable token
(no content, just the tag itself)
```

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### First Sync (SyncKey 1‚Üí2)

**Request:**

```xml
<Sync>
  <Collections>
    <Collection>
      <SyncKey>1</SyncKey>
      <CollectionId>1</CollectionId>
    </Collection>
  </Collections>
</Sync>
```

**Response (CORRECTED):**

```xml
<Sync>
  <Status>1</Status>
  <Collections>
    <Collection>
      <SyncKey>2</SyncKey>
      <CollectionId>1</CollectionId>
      <Status>1</Status>
      <Class>Email</Class>
      <MoreAvailable/>  <!-- ‚úÖ NOW PRESENT! -->
      <Commands>
        <Add>
          <ServerId>1:27</ServerId>
          <ApplicationData>
            <!-- Email 27 data -->
          </ApplicationData>
        </Add>
      </Commands>
    </Collection>
  </Collections>
</Sync>
```

**Outlook's Expected Reaction:**

```
1. Receives response ‚úÖ
2. Sees <MoreAvailable/> tag ‚úÖ
3. Displays first email in inbox ‚úÖ
4. Immediately sends next Sync request with SyncKey=2 ‚úÖ
```

### Second Sync (SyncKey 2‚Üí3)

**Request:**

```xml
<Sync>
  <Collections>
    <Collection>
      <SyncKey>2</SyncKey>  <!-- Confirms receipt of batch 1 -->
      <CollectionId>1</CollectionId>
    </Collection>
  </Collections>
</Sync>
```

**Response:**

```xml
<Sync>
  <Status>1</Status>
  <Collections>
    <Collection>
      <SyncKey>3</SyncKey>
      <CollectionId>1</CollectionId>
      <Status>1</Status>
      <Class>Email</Class>
      <MoreAvailable/>  <!-- Still more emails -->
      <Commands>
        <Add>
          <ServerId>1:26</ServerId>
          <!-- Email 26 data -->
        </Add>
      </Commands>
    </Collection>
  </Collections>
</Sync>
```

**Expected Result:**

- Outlook downloads emails in batches of ~6-7 emails (~50KB each)
- Each batch confirms previous before requesting next
- Continues until `<MoreAvailable/>` absent
- Two-phase commit ensures reliable delivery

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Trigger New Sync in Outlook

**Option A:** Send/Receive (F9)  
**Option B:** Remove and re-add ActiveSync account

### 2. Monitor Logs

```bash
tail -f logs/activesync/activesync.log | grep -E "outlook_batch_size_limiting|sync_emails_sent|MoreAvailable"
```

### 3. Expected Log Output

```json
{
  "event": "outlook_batch_size_limiting",
  "emails_selected": 1,
  "batch_size_bytes": 44696,
  "has_more": true
}
```

```json
{
  "event": "sync_emails_sent_wbxml_simple",
  "email_count_sent": 1,
  "has_more": true,
  "wbxml_length": 5049
}
```

**NEW:** WBXML should now include `0x50` (MoreAvailable token)

### 4. Expected Outlook Behavior

```
‚úÖ Sync(0‚Üí1): Empty response
‚úÖ Sync(1‚Üí2): 1 email delivered
‚úÖ Sync(2‚Üí3): 1 email delivered  ‚Üê Should happen now!
‚úÖ Sync(3‚Üí4): 1 email delivered
...
‚úÖ All 17 emails downloaded progressively
```

## Why This Bug Was Missed

1. **Old Experiment:** Someone tested removing `MoreAvailable` to see if it fixed Outlook issues
2. **Never Reverted:** The commented-out code was left in place
3. **iPhone Still Worked:** iPhone doesn't strictly require `MoreAvailable` for initial sync
4. **Logs Were Misleading:** Python code logged `"has_more": true` but WBXML didn't include it
5. **No WBXML Validation:** We weren't decoding/validating the actual WBXML bytes

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Validate WBXML Output

- Don't trust Python logs alone
- Decode actual WBXML bytes to verify structure
- Use WBXML decoder tools for validation

### 2. Comment Cleanup

- Never leave experimental code commented out
- Either commit the change or revert it completely
- Use feature flags for experiments, not comments

### 3. Z-Push Compliance

- Strictly follow Z-Push/Grommunio implementation
- Empty elements (`<MoreAvailable/>`) must be present when `true`
- MS-ASCMD spec is not optional

### 4. Test With Multiple Clients

- iPhone is more forgiving than Outlook
- Outlook strictly validates WBXML structure
- Test with both before declaring success

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger sync in Outlook** (F9 or re-add account)
2. **Monitor logs** for progressive batch downloads
3. **Verify inbox** populates with all 17 emails
4. **Confirm two-phase commit** (pending state in logs)
5. **Test iOS** to ensure no regression

---

**Expected Final Result:** Outlook downloads all 17 emails in ~3-4 batches (5-6 emails each, ~50KB per batch), with proper two-phase commit and MoreAvailable pagination. ‚úÖ
