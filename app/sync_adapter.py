"""
Adapter to integrate the expert's SyncStateStore with our FastAPI/SQLAlchemy application.

This module:
1. Converts our DB Email models to simple dicts for the expert's WBXML builder
2. Wraps the expert's in-memory state store so it persists to our database
3. Provides a single clean interface for the activesync.py router
